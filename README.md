# HTML-Basics
Welcome to the HTML Basics Reference repository! This collection is a personal compilation of essential HTML concepts and syntaxes. Each file in this repo corresponds to a lesson I've completed, covering various fundamental elements and structures of HTML.

What you'll find: 
  1. HTML Boilerplate
  2. Anchor Elements
  3. Heading Elements
  4. Paragraph Elements
  5. Image Elements
  6. List Elements 
  7. Void Elements
  8. Nesting and Indentation

This is a growing resource intended to reinforce my learning of HTML and act as a reference for beginners. Iâ€™ll continue to add more topics as I progress through my lessons.

Feel free to browse, learn, or contribute!
