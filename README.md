# HTML-Basics
Welcome to the HTML Basics Reference repository! This collection is a personal compilation of essential HTML concepts and syntaxes. Each file in this repo corresponds to a lesson I've completed, covering various fundamental elements and structures of HTML.

What you'll find: 
  1. HTML Boilerplate – The standard structure of an HTML document.
  2. Anchor Elements – Creating links using <a>.
  3. Heading Elements – Usage of <h1> through <h6>.
  4. Paragraph Elements – Formatting text using <p>.
  5. Image Elements – Displaying images using <img>.
  6. List Elements – Ordered and unordered lists using <ol>, <ul>, and <li>.
  7. Void Elements – Elements that don’t require closing tags.
  8. Nesting and Indentation – Best practices for readability and structure.

This is a growing resource intended to reinforce my learning of HTML and act as a reference for beginners. I’ll continue to add more topics as I progress through my lessons.

Feel free to browse, learn, or contribute!
